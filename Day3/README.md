QUESTION 1:
Given an integer array arr and a mapping function fn, return a new array with a transformation applied to each element.

The returned array should be created such that returnedArray[i] = fn(arr[i], i).

Please solve it without the built-in Array.map method.


Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function plusone(n) { return n + 1; }
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation:
const newArray = map(arr, plusone); // [2,3,4]
The function increases each value in the array by one. 

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function plusI(n, i) { return n + i; }
Output: [1,3,5]
Explanation: The function increases each value by the index it resides in.

Example 3:

Input: arr = [10,20,30], fn = function constant() { return 42; }
Output: [42,42,42]
Explanation: The function always returns 42.

QUESTION 2:

Given an integer array arr and a filtering function fn, return a filtered array filteredArr.

The fn function takes one or two arguments:

arr[i] - number from the arr
i - index of arr[i]
filteredArr should only contain the elements from the arr for which the expression fn(arr[i], i) evaluates to a truthy value. A truthy value is a value where Boolean(value) returns true.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.filter method.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,10,20,30], fn = function greaterThan10(n) { return n > 10; }
Output: [20,30]
Explanation:
const newArray = filter(arr, fn); // [20, 30]
The function filters out values that are not greater than 10

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function firstIndex(n, i) { return i === 0; }
Output: [1]
Explanation:
fn can also accept the index of each element
In this case, the function removes elements not at index 0

Example 3:

Input: arr = [-2,-1,0,1,2], fn = function plusOne(n) { return n + 1 }
Output: [-2,0,1,2]
Explanation:
Falsey values such as 0 should be filtered out
